This is the repository page for the [@e621tagbot](https://twitter.com/e621tagbot) on Twitter. Here you'll find the tags which the bot tweets and some code.

Although this version of the bot has been completely coded by me, I'd like to thank [v buckenham](https://v21.io) for making the [Cheap Bots, Done Quick!](http://cheapbotsdonequick.com/) platform, which hosted the bot for over 2 years. Without it, the bot would've never existed lol.

# Tag Threshold
As a way for the bot to not get too weird after changing to the complete tag database ( b77417bfdb4f9230d3c7124db8eb631e8f84c948 ), I decided to implement Thresholds depending on the category of the tag. The current limits are shown on the table below.
